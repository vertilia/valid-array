# valid-array

Data filtering mechanism based on native `php-filter` extension with additional capacities.

A `ValidArray` object receives on instantiation an associative array with elements names as keys and elements filters as
values. These filters guarantee that when we set corresponding elements in this object, they will automatically get
validated and their valid value will be stored. If an element does not pass validation, a default value may be used
basing on filter parameters. Elements may be used as normal array, validation is done on element modification.
`ValidArray` extends SPL `ArrayObject` and wraps the functionality of `php-filter` extension.

## Introduction

PHP native data validation mechanism using standard `php-filter` extension is a great way of working with data, to
ensure user input correctness and to protect against several attack vectors. This extension is bundled with PHP and is
available by default in most configurations, which makes it a natural choice for any project requiring data validation.

As a bundled extension, `php-filter` benefits from documentation coverage in [PHP manual](https://php.net/filter),
performance gain of compiled-in module and quasi-absolute availability.

While being a de-facto standard for data validation in PHP, it still suffers from several questionable architectural
decisions that were made at the early days and that today slow down the learning curve and development pace when
implementing validation strategy in user code.

Two of these dubious decisions:

- ðŸ¤¨ `default` value is implemented for limited number of filters, only to replace invalid arguments, but not for cases
  when argument is not supplied,
- ðŸ¤” limited `FILTER_CALLBACK` functionality, when flags are ignored and validation callback cannot distinguish scalar
  data from array.

Based on numerous strengths of `php-filter` extension, `ValidArray` class corrects beforementioned flaws and
implements `php-filter` functionality into a useful and predictable data structure with the following features:

- associative arrays with validation mechanism,
- validation is provided on array instantiation and item modification,
- filters are set at data object instantiation,
- useful for input / output parameters validation,
- minimal footprint,
- extending `ArrayObject` allows for natural array handling in user code,
- use of standard `php-filter` extension with enhanced handling of default values and callback filter.

## Example

Enough talks, let's see how it works.

We shall handle a login POST request with `email`, `password` and `uri` parameters that need validation.

The route `POST /api/login` will call `LoginController` and pass request parameters in an array which should have 3
fields: `email`, `password` and `uri`. All fields should have valid data, which is defined as follows:

- `email` is a string with valid email address or `false` if not valid,
- `password` is a string with hashed version of sent password or `false` if not valid. Valid password is a string of at
  least 8 characters,
- `uri` is a string with path for the next page to redirect after login or `#member` by default.

#### Implementing required validation with `php-filter` (1st attempt):

```php
<?php

// filter input
$vars = filter_input_array(
    INPUT_POST,
    [
        'email' => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL,
        'password' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_CALLBACK,
            'options' => function ($pwd) {return (strlen($pwd) >= 8) ? password_hash($pwd, PASSWORD_BCRYPT) : false;},
        ],
        'uri' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_DEFAULT,
            'options' => ['default' => '#member'],  // @attention
        ],
    ]
);

// create controller
$controller = get_controller_for_route('/api/login', $vars);

// call controller
$controller->run();
```

> If you need help with using `php-filter` extension have a look at [official documentation](http://php.net/filter).

Now, this will partly work. Until someone discovers out login api and decides to bring our system down with several absolutely
legitimate requests of the following form (newlines added for readability):

```
email=abc@def.com
&uri=%23index
&password[]=12345678
&password[]=12345678
&password[]=12345678
...
&password[]=12345678
```

When `php-filter` extension sees an array sent, its default behavior is to validate every item in this array via the
provided filter and keep this array structure in place replacing array values with filtered values. In most cases this
may be a correct behavior (anyway that's how filter extension works), but in our case this will start calculating
password hashes for all the provided passwords, and this is a very CPU intensive task.

`php-filter` has a very elegant solution for this situation, which is called filter flags, and our first intention will
be to set the `FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR`.

#### Set `FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR` flag (2nd attempt):

```php
<?php
// filter input
$vars = filter_input_array(
    INPUT_POST,
    [
        'email' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
        ],
        'password' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_CALLBACK,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,       // @attention
            'options' => function ($pwd) {return (strlen($pwd) >= 8) ? password_hash($pwd, PASSWORD_BCRYPT) : false;},
        ],
        'uri' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_DEFAULT,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
            'options' => ['default' => '#member'],  // @attention
        ],
    ]
);

// create controller
$controller = get_controller_for_route('/api/login', $vars);

// call controller
$controller->run();
```

Nothing wrong with this approach, and it will work fine for `email` and `uri` fields, but not for the `password` field.
Yes, `FILTER_CALLBACK` [ignores flags by design](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.misc.php). You cannot do
anything with it, so before the validation step you'll likely want to add a verification to catch the possibility of
array passed as `password` argument.

Other thing, and also up to you to handle correctly, is the fact that default value provided via the `default` flag, is
only used when [the parameter is provided but is not valid](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.validate.php).
It is not available for all filters (not for `FILTER_DEFAULT` by the way), it will not be used if any sanitize-filter
shrinks parameter value down to empty string, and finally, it will not be used if parameter was not set in request.

So our final version should handle these additional conditions.

#### Handle array type and default value manually (3rd attempt):

```php
<?php
// filter input
$post = $_POST;
if (is_array($post['password'] ?? null)) {
    $post['password'] = false;
}
if (empty($post['uri'])) {
    $post['uri'] = '#member';
}
$vars = filter_var_array(
    $post,
    [
        'email' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
        ],
        'password' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_CALLBACK,
            'options' => function ($pwd) {return (strlen($pwd) >= 8) ? password_hash($pwd, PASSWORD_BCRYPT) : false;},
        ],
        'uri' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_DEFAULT,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
        ],
    ]
);

// create controller
$controller = get_controller_for_route('/api/login', $vars);

// call controller
$controller->run();
```

This is definitely not the most beautiful piece of code and that is where `ValidArray` is improving the situation.

Consider the same example, but implemented using `ValidArray` functionality:

#### Implementing required validation with `ValidArray`:

```php
<?php

use Vertilia\ValidArray;

$vars = new ValidArray(
    [
        'email' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
        ],
        'password' => [
            'filter' => ValidArray::FILTER_EXTENDED_CALLBACK,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
            'options' => [
                'callback' => function ($pwd) {
                    return (strlen($pwd) >= 8) ? password_hash($pwd, PASSWORD_BCRYPT) : false;
                }
            ],
        ],
        'uri' => [
            'filter' => FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING,
            'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
            'options' => ['default' => '#member'],
        ],
    ],
    $_POST
);

// create controller
$controller = get_controller_for_route('/api/login', $vars);

// call controller
$controller->run();
```

Notable distinctions between `ValidArray` and `filter_*()` functions:

- `ValidArray` is an object but allows array-style access to elements since extending `ArrayObject` SPL class;
- it allows using `default` values for missing parameters for all filters;
- it provides `ValidArray::FILTER_EXTENDED_CALLBACK` filter allowing to define callbacks that unlock both `flags`
  and `default` functionality;
- `ValidArray` always uses `$add_empty` mode of `filter_var_array()` function and does not allow to unset elements
  that have filters defined. Updating filters is allowed when using `MutableValidArray` class.

## More use cases

In a specific controller we handle the following request parameters:

```json
{
    "id": {"type": "integer"},
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "email": {"type": "string"},
    "tel": {"type": "string"}
}
```

So we define the following filters:

```php
$filters = [
    'id' => [
        'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_INT,
        'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
    ],
    'name' => [
        'filter' => FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING,
        'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
    ],
    'email' => [
        'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL,
        'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
    ],
    'tel' => [
        'filter' => FILTER_VALIDATE_REGEXP,
        'flags' => FILTER_REQUIRE_SCALAR,
        'options' => [
            'regexp' => '/^\+?\d+(?:[. ()-]{1,2}\d+)*$/',
            'default' => '+00 (0)0 00 00 00 00',
        ],
    ],
];
```

We then create a `ValidArray` instance passing there predefined `$filters` and the value of the `$_REQUEST`:

```php
$va = new ValidArray($filters, $_REQUEST);
```

Now we can be sure that array items in `$va` are exactly 4 (`id`, `name`, `email`, `tel`), that each of them is of
corresponding type or `null` if not provided in request or `false` if incoming value does not correspond to definition
in filter. The default value for `tel` element will be used if not provided or invalid.

Since `ValidArray` extends `ArrayObject`, its elements may be accessed (added, iterated etc.) via normal array notation:

```php
$va['name'] = 'John Snow';
echo "{$va['name']}\n";
// prints: John Snow

foreach ($va as $name => $value) {
    printf("'%s' => %s,\n", $name, var_export($value, true));
    // prints: 'name' => 'John Snow',
}
```

When setting `ValidArray` values, they are automatically validated using the predefined filters. Here again, if
provided value does not pass validation, `false` is set instead (or `null` if `FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE` flag is set).

```php
$va['email'] = 'unknown';
echo $va['email']; // prints nothing since `$va['email']` is `false`
```

## More examples

For the following request parameters:

```json
{
    "id": 175,
    "name": "John Snow",
    "email": "john.snow@winterfell.com",
    "tel": "322-223"
}
```

`$va` contents will be:

```php
[
    'id' => 175,
    'name' => 'John Snow',
    'email' => 'john.snow@winterfell.com',
    'tel' => '322-223',
]
```

For incorrect request parameters:

```json
{
    "id": [1, "' OR 1 -- "],
    "name": "X",
    "another": true,
    "admin": 1
}
```

`$va` contents will be:

```php
[
    'id' => false,
    'name' => 'X',
    'email' => null,
    'tel' => "+00 (0)0 00 00 00 00",
]
```

Here, correct parameters will be present, all unknown parameters will be ignored, missing parameters will be set to
`null` or provided `default` value, and incorrect parameters will be set to `false`.
